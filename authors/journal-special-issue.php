                        Authors of selected accepted ISCAS 2024 papers will be invited to submit a paper for possible publication either in:

                        <li>

                    <p>
                        Invitations will be made by a team of Guest Associate Editors on the basis of the timeliness and quality of technical results presented, the outcome of the review process and the recommendations of the Review Committee Members (RCMs) and Track Chairs (TCs) who were involved in the review process itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authors of the selected papers will receive an invitation email with detailed instructions on how to submit a manuscript derived from their ISCAS paper to the Scholar One web site for one of the participating journals. 
                        <li>
                            For invitations to TCAS-I, or TBioCAS, or TVLSI, the new manuscript shall be a substantially expanded version of the corresponding ISCAS paper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For invitations to TCAS-II, the new manuscript shall be a minor revision of the ISCAS paper (the maximum length of a TCAS-II paper is five pages only).
                        </li>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Important Note</h3>
                    <p><b>
                        Papers submitted to TCAS-II, if accepted, will represent the only record published in IEEE Xplore. In other words, the corresponding ISCAS paper, being largely overlapped, will not appear in the ISCAS 2024 version of the Proceedings uploaded to IEEE Xplore. Author registration requirements will be the same as for regular ISCAS papers, as well as the implicit obligation to present the paper during the conference.
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authors who do not wish to consider this option for publication will have, at submission time, the possibility to opt-out from having their ISCAS submission considered for possible invitation to TCAS-II.
