2.	AI-Enhanced Implementation of High-Efficiency Delta-Sigma ADCs
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 8:30 - 12:00
High-efficiency oversampling analog-digital converters (ADCs) are still at the forefront of integrated circuits and very popular when it comes to research and development, both in industry and academia. While their implementation as noise-shaping SAR ADCs comes with the drawback of driving a large sampling capacitor merged with the capacitive DAC, the delta sigma modulator (DSM) based converter omits this. Their application range is huge, from wideband wireless communications to the data acquisition in IoT sensor nodes that demands
an ultra-high resolution with very low power consumption. Due to the available high integrator gain within the signal bandwidth and the feedback established by the oversampling converters, they can achieve a relatively high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR), within the signal band of interest. The ability to shape the unwanted noise and errors to the out-of-the-band gains a substantial design degree of freedom to the oversampling converters compared to their Nyquist counterparts. DSM is found in two basic categories: Discrete-Time (DT) DSM with excellent accuracy and also excellent power efficiency in recent dynamic implementations. Continuous-Time (CT) DSM comes with important benefits of inherent anti-aliasing filtering, easier drivability, and power-efficient implementation due to the continuous-time signal processing. Moreover, the architectural diversity of DSM has steadily increased over the last decades, beyond others employing various kinds of multi-stage designs, and incremental DSM have recently again gained an increasing attention. Circuit designers should understand the underlying trade-offs in detail before they can make the correct design decisions.
This tutorial will provide a detailed review of the fundamentals, important decision-making factors, recent trends and advanced design techniques, and future perspectives on the state-of-the-art oversampling delta-sigma converters, spanning a range from DT to CT, free-running and incremental one. Moreover, regarding the practical implementation, we will go through the classical methods, covering the optimization-based loop-filter design, and then guide the audience through the most recent advances of AI-based synthesis and implementation of DSMs, both on systems and circuitry levels.

5.	CoDeCAS: Co-designing Devices, Circuits, Systems and Algorithms for Uncertainty aware Multimodal Artificial Intelligence at the Edge
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 8:30 - 12:00
Uncertainty awareness in language and vision AI models are essential for robust decision making in critical real-time tasks at the Edge such as autonomous drone surveillance, and AR/VR-assisted healthcare. Model predictions often suffer from data, sensor and environmental imperfections leading to inaccurate decision making that is unacceptable in safety critical tasks. Various probabilistic AI techniques such as Monte-Carlo Dropout, Variational inference, Deep ensembles and Conformal predictions enable uncertainty awareness in the AI model predictions. However, challenges to deep learning inference at the Edge further aggravates with incorporation of prediction uncertainties due to multifold increase in compute and power requirements. We uniquely address these challenges all the way from novel device technology to circuits, architectures and co-designed algorithms, thus navigating the audience to the full stack research techniques and
hardware/software co-design frameworks towards building sustainable as well as robust circuits and systems for modern AI processing.

9.	From SNNs to Silicon: Automated hardware deployment of spiking neural networks
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 8:30 - 12:00
Brain-inspired spiking neural networks promise 3–4 orders of magnitude energy savings compared to conventional neural network implementations. SNNs combine continuous neuron dynamics with discrete spike communication, enabling rich temporal computation with efficient, event-driven information transfer—these are among the key ingredients allowing the human brain to operate on approximately 20 watts.
This tutorial provides an overview of unrolling SNNs defined in a collection of simulators into FPGA bitstreams via a customisable, open-source toolchain. We introduce a direct compilation framework that translates SNN models into FPGA bitstreams: participants will convert an existing spiking convolutional network to hardware, then train and optimise their own architecture. Participants will learn to program FPGA accelerators for SNNs and gain practical skills in mapping conventional network architectures into the spiking domain. This toolchain also serves as a stepping stone toward open-source neuromorphic ASIC development.

 1.	Low-voltage frequency generation, modulation, and demodulation circuits for mobile IoT
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 13:30 - 17:00
As future wireless systems leveraging advanced CMOS technologies demand not only low-power but also low-voltage design, robust frequency generation, modulation and demodulation have become more critical than ever. In particular, sub-0.5V frequency synthesis and modulation are essential to enable battery-free operation in mobile IoT devices, as they can be directly powered by energy harvesters without requiring additional DC-DC converters. However, designing a low-voltage fractional-N PLL is highly challenging, since both matching and linearity degrade significantly as the supply voltage is scaled down. 
This half-day tutorial reviews the state-of-the-art PLL architectures and presents fully voltage-mode PLL and transceiver architectures that operate under a 0.5V supply voltage. In addition, the extensive use of single-bit modulation and demodulation techniques for the robust design of ultra-low-voltage transmitters and receivers will be discussed.

3.	Intelligent Design of Wireless Power Transfer: From Fundamentals to AI-Driven Frameworks 
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 13:30 - 17:00
Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention as an innovative technology enabling a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to industrial robotics. The development of efficient and reliable WPT systems, particularly in the MHz frequency range, requires the integrated consideration of circuits, magnetic coupling, electric-field coupling, and control. Conventional design approaches, largely dependent on expert knowledge and trial-and-error prototyping, face inherent limitations: they struggle to address fundamental challenges such as output fluctuation and efficiency degradation caused by load variation and coil misalignment, thereby restricting scalability and innovation.
This tutorial will provide both the fundamentals and the latest advancements in WPT, with a special focus on methods that fundamentally overcome these challenges. Beginning with the principles of inductive and electric-field (capacitive) coupling, the tutorial will cover advanced load-independent topologies and our uniquely developed AI-driven design methodologies, characterized by fully numerical optimization, high-accuracy modeling, and the integrated design of physical coil models with circuit component values. Beyond serving as a powerful design tool, these approaches represent a novel framework for principle-driven analysis and knowledge discovery in WPT system design. Practical case studies, including MHz-range GaN inverters and robotic applications, will demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. Future directions such as Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer (SWPDT) will also be briefly discussed.

Designing PAs over such diverse regimes is challenging: designers must balance efficiency, linearity, and integration constraints, all of which vary with the semiconductor platform. CMOS, SOI, SiGe, and III-V technologies each bring different strengths and limitations, influencing achievable performance, power handling, and manufacturability.
This tutorial walks through PA design from fundamentals to advanced techniques. We start with classical PA architectures and key performance metrics at lower frequencies, then move to millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz designs, discussing power-combining methods, Doherty-inspired architectures, parasitic effects, and layout considerations. Process-specific trade-offs are highlighted, illustrated with real-world case studies that show how design choices impact performance across different technologies and frequency bands.
Finally, we look ahead to emerging trends and challenges in PA design, including integration, scalability, and design automation. By the end of the session, participants will have a clear understanding of the frequency- and process-dependent trade-offs that define modern PA design and practical guidance for building efficient, high-performance amplifiers for next-generation wireless and sensing systems.

7.	Mm-Wave to THz Signal Generation in CMOS: An Injection Locking Approach
Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 13:30 - 17:00
Moving to higher frequencies become a consensus in communication and radar society for wider bandwidth and smaller form factor, thereby gestating new applications spread from mm-wave to THz frequency bands, including 5G new radio (NR), 6G communication, automotive radar, and THz sensing. Unlike the traditional high-frequency signal generation in vacuum tube, which inherently has high power and low phase noise, new demands on power, size, and cost force the
signal generation to be fully integrated on a silicon chip, but with sacrificed performances.
In this tutorial, we focus on the fundamental limitations of signal generation in CMOS from mm-wave to THz frequencies, and the design trade-offs among operating frequencies, bandwidth, phase noise, and power consumption. We will introduce new signal generation topologies based on an injection-locking technique and discuss the design methodology of high-frequency signal generators. This tutorial includes discussion of fundamental problems on silicon-based high-frequency signal generation, design of silicon-based oscillators and phase-locked loops (PLL), introduction of the injection-locking technique and how does it benefit for high-frequency signal generations, design examples of mm-wave and THz injection-locked signal sources, and their applications in communication and radar systems.

Sunday | May 24, 2026 | 13:30 - 17:00
This tutorial surveys recent advances in learning-based data compression, focusing on achieving high performance with low computational complexity. While neural compression now rivals traditional codecs, its computational cost remains a barrier to practical deployment. This tutorial is structured into two interconnected parts to address this challenge. The first part establishes a foundational understanding of state-of-the-art learned compression for images and video. Then we’ll explore efficient strategies including: (1) linear attention models (Mamba, RWKV) as alternatives of transformer and convolutions; (2) knowledge distillation for compact models; and (3) integrated restoration techniques for enhanced rate-distortion performance. The second part extends these principles to diverse modalities, covering sequential data (text, speech, tactile), multi-view representations (Gaussian Splatting, NeRF), and joint frameworks that share coding tools across data types to enable hardware savings. We conclude with key challenges and future directions for multimodal data handling and lightweight architectures.
