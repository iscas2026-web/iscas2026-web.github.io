                                        Professor of Physics<br>
                                        University of Science and Technology of China

                                    <p class="abstract-text">With the continued development of quantum information science, it is anticipated that large-scale quantum networks will be established. Such networks are expected to enable ultra-precise information sensing through quantum metrology, secure and efficient information exchange via quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation, and rapid information processing through quantum computing.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">However, turning quantum networks from theoretical concepts into practical reality still faces numerous technical challenges. Achieving secure long-distance quantum communication requires addressing security issues under realistic conditions and overcoming the inherent loss in optical fibers, while building quantum computers demands solving the challenge of scalable and precise manipulation of qubits.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">In this talk, I review our two-decade efforts toward quantum networks, including: developing decoy-state QKD and measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD to close device imperfections loopholes; progressing quantum repeaters and satellites to extend communication range; using photon coherent manipulation techniques developed from quantum communication to demonstrate quantum computational advantage; employing ultracold atoms in optical lattices for quantum simulations of complex systems, advancing near-term quantum computing applications; surpassing the surface code quantum error correction threshold; and developing high-precision optical lattice clocks using ultracold atom technology.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">Future prospects include building a global quantum communication network using efficient constellations and geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. This will also support advanced quantum metrology, potentially redefining the SI second. In quantum computation, our five-year plan targets practical quantum simulators to study high-temperature superconductivity, quantum Hall effect, etc. Over the next 10–15 years, scaling to millions of qubits with quantum error correction may lay the foundation for universal quantum computers.</p>

                                    <p class="abstract-text">Unprecedented vision systems capable of sensing, timing, and interpreting individual photons are rapidly reshaping applications that span engineering, autonomy, and healthcare. At the core of this transformation are single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and their tight integration with advanced silicon circuits, modeling frameworks, and system architectures. This presentation will trace a trajectory from device-level physics and pixel engineering to large-scale sensing and health systems enabled by single-photon technologies. We first highlight recent advances in physics-based SPAD modeling, including compact Verilog-A descriptions of noise and calibrated photon detection probability models that accurately capture process, optical stack, and variability effects. These models provide predictive, simulator-compatible tools essential for noise-aware co-design of SPADs and readout circuits. We then examine circuit and pixel innovations, such as high-speed quench and reset schemes, time-gated and clock-driven operation, and integrated time-to-digital converters that push timing resolution into the picosecond regime while mitigating dead time, afterpulsing, and intersymbol interference. Building on these foundations, we discuss system-level realizations, including SPAD-based optical wireless communication receivers, automotive LiDAR sensors, and time-resolved biomedical imagers, where single-photon sensitivity translates directly into extended range, improved robustness, and enhanced diagnostic capability. By unifying device physics, compact modeling, circuit architectures, and application-driven system design, this work illustrates how single-photon detectors are evolving from isolated pixels into enabling platforms for next-generation engineering and health systems, offering unprecedented vision across scales, ranging from individual photons to complex real-world environments.</p>

                                    <span class="section-label">Abstract</span>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">At the dawn of 2026, DeepSeek-AI published the engram module which marks the birth of the memory-dominant large language models. Traditional Transformers with attention and MoE lack efficient native knowledge lookup, forcing repeated expensive recomputation of static patterns (common phrases, entities, local dependencies) and wasting depth and cycles.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">Engram introduces conditional memory as a new sparsity axis: modernized N-gram embeddings enable O(1) deterministic lookups, offloading static knowledge to scalable parameterized tables (100B+ parameters). The Transformer backbone focuses solely on dynamic global reasoning and long-range dependencies. Its infrastructure-aware design achieves near-zero-overhead DRAM prefetching follows a U-shaped scaling law, and delivers outsized gains: Engram-27B outperforms MoE baselines at matched FLOPs with power-law "infinite memory" scaling.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">This exposes AI's next bottleneck: memory access patterns, tail latency, and organization -- no longer peak FLOPS. MRDIMM delivers a bandwidth uplift and lower latency for Engram's random, high-concurrency accesses, enabling robust O(1) lookups in demanding inference scenarios. CXL provides disaggregated, pooled, coherent memory pools across nodes, allowing massive Engram tables to reside in shared memory -- eliminating replication, bypassing HBM limits, and (with compression) doubling effective capacity at lower TCO.</p>
                                    <p class="abstract-text">Together, Engram + MRDIMM + CXL forge a genuinely memory-first sparse AI paradigm: computation specializes in deep reasoning, while memory specializes in high-speed storage and retrieval of knowledge -- finally circumventing the GPU memory wall and unlocking the next phase of efficient, scalable intelligence.</p>

                                    <p class="bio-text">Dr. Howard C. Yang co-founded Montage Technology in 2004 and has served as its Chairman and CEO since its inception. From 1990 to 1994, Dr. Yang was engaged in integrated circuit (IC) R&D and design at National Semiconductor Corp. and other Silicon Valley companies. In 1994, he returned to China and established the country's first IC design center employing modern design methodologies. In 1997, he co-founded Newave Semiconductor Corp., China's first venture capital-backed IC design company, which later merged with a major U.S. semiconductor firm in 2001 -- a transaction ranked among China's top ten mergers of the year.</p>
                                    <p class="bio-text">Dr. Yang is an IEEE Life Fellow and has received several distinguished awards, including the IEEE CAS Industrial Pioneer Award, the JEDEC Distinguished Executive Leadership Award, and the Magnolia Gold Award from the Shanghai Municipal Government. He holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University and was inducted into its Engineering Hall of Fame in 2024.</p>
